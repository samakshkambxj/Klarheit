## Q&A

- **What is Global Mode?**

    > Creates a single AudioEffect on session ID 0 (the global mix). The Android audio framework
    > routes all audio through session 0, so one effect instance processes everything. This is the
    > simplest and most compatible mode.

- **What is Per-App Mode?**

    > Creates a separate AudioEffect for each audio player's session ID. The DSP processes each
    > app's audio independently. Requires **either root or installation as a privileged system app**
    > (see below).

- **Why does Per-App Mode require root (or a system-app install)?**

    > On modern Android (API 34+ / Android 14+), the framework no longer broadcasts
    > `OPEN_AUDIO_EFFECT_CONTROL_SESSION`, and `AudioManager.getActivePlaybackConfigurations()`
    > returns anonymized session IDs (`sessionId:0, u/pid:-1/-1`) to ordinary apps. The app uses
    > `AudioPlaybackCallback` to detect playback state changes, then needs a privileged path to
    > recover the real session ID. Two paths are supported:
    >
    > - **Root (default):** the real session ID is read via `su -c "dumpsys audio"`.
    > - **Privileged system app (no root):** if the app is installed under `/system/priv-app`
    >   and granted the `MODIFY_AUDIO_ROUTING` permission, the framework returns the real
    >   (non-anonymized) `sessionId`/`clientUid` directly from `getActivePlaybackConfigurations()`,
    >   so no root and no `dumpsys` shell-out is needed. The app auto-detects this at runtime
    >   (the permission grant is the trigger) and prefers it over the root path.

- **How do I install as a privileged system app (per-app mode without root)?**

    > Place the APK in `/system/priv-app/ViPER4Android/` and add a privileged-permission
    > allowlist so the OS grants `MODIFY_AUDIO_ROUTING`:
    >
    > ```xml
    > <!-- /system/etc/permissions/privapp-permissions-viper4android.xml -->
    > <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    > <permissions>
    >     <privapp-permissions package="com.llsl.viper4android">
    >         <permission name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_ROUTING"/>
    >     </privapp-permissions>
    > </permissions>
    > ```
    >
    > This is done for you when the app ships inside a ROM or a Magisk module that mounts it
    > systemlessly. Without the allowlist entry the permission is silently **denied**
    > (with `ro.control_privapp_permissions=enforce`, the default), and the app falls back to the
    > root path. No platform signature is required, priv-app placement satisfies the `privileged`
    > half of the `signature|privileged` protection level.
    >
    > Note that you may need allow the following SElinux rules for the app (as system app) to work:
    >
    > ```sh
    > allow priv_app servicemanager service_manager list
    > allow priv_app viper_control_service service_manager find
    > allow priv_app default_android_service service_manager find
    > allow priv_app hal_audio_default binder { call transfer }
    > ```

- **What is Per-Device Profile?**

    > Each audio device (e.g., "Galaxy Buds Pro", "Airpods", "Speaker") keeps its own saved effect
    > settings, loaded automatically on connect and saved when the app goes to the background. See [Per-Device Profiles](#per-device-profiles) for details.

- **What is AIDL Mode?**
    > Android 14+ introduced a new Audio HAL interface based on AIDL (Android Interface Definition Language),
    > replacing the legacy HIDL interface. The App automatically check which HAL your device using.

## Presets

Presets are stored in the **v2 grouped-JSON format** (`schemaVersion: 2.1`):

> v2.1 stores the raw semantic values that send to the DSP

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2.1,
  "name": "My Preset",
  "equalizer": { "enable": true, "bandCount": 10, "bands": [3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0], "presetId": null },
  "dynamicEq": { "enable": false, "bandCount": 4, "freqs": [...], "gains": [...] },
  "ddc": { "enable": false, "device": "" }
}
```

### Migrating v1 / legacy presets to v2 and v2.1

v2 is **not** compatible with the old flat v1 JSON or the legacy ViPER4Android XML presets. Two migration paths are available:

1. **In-app export (recommended).** In the last v1 app release (1.5.5), use **Export preset as v2** to produce a `.v2.json` file, then import it in v2.
2. **Command-line tool.** For v1 JSON or legacy XML presets, use [`tools/convert_preset.py`](tools/convert_preset.py) (Python 3.11+):

    ```bash
    # v1 flat JSON  ->  v2.1
    python3 tools/convert_preset.py preset.json --to 2.1 -o preset.v2.json
    # legacy ViPER4Android XML  ->  v2.1
    python3 tools/convert_preset.py preset.xml --to 2.1 -o preset.v2.json
    # v2 -> v2.1
    python3 tools/convert_preset.py preset.v2.json -o preset.v2_1.json
    ```

The input format (v1 JSON vs. XML) and, for v1 JSON, the headphone/speaker namespace are auto-detected.
Missing fields are filled with the app defaults. Import the resulting `.v2.1.json` in the app.

> [!NOTE]
> v2 no longer stores separate headphone and speaker copies inside a preset. A preset now holds a
> single unified effect state and is applied to a device through the per-device profile system.

## Per-Device Profiles

Each audio output device keeps its **own** full effect profile. When you switch outputs, the app
automatically loads the incoming device's profile, so your speaker, wired earphones, and each pair
of Bluetooth buds all remember their own tuning.

### How a device is identified

The active output is detected from the Android audio routing API, and each device gets a stable `deviceId`:

- **Speaker** → `speaker`
- **Wired headphone / headset** → `wired_headphone`
- **Bluetooth** (A2DP / BLE / hearing aid) → the device's **MAC address** (falls back to `bt_<id>` if unavailable)
- **USB DAC / headset** → the USB device **address** (falls back to `usb_<id>`)

Because Bluetooth and USB devices are keyed by their hardware address, two different pairs of buds
are stored separately, and reconnecting the same device restores exactly its profile. The display
name comes from the device's reported product name (e.g. "Galaxy Buds Pro"), with a type-based fallback ("Bluetooth A2DP", "USB Audio", ...).

### When profiles are saved and loaded

- **On output switch**: the app detects the new active device, **loads** its profile.
- **On app background** (home button, app switch / `ON_STOP`) and **on shutdown**: the current settings are saved to the active device's profile.
- **First time a device is seen**: a profile is created automatically from the current settings.

### Managing profiles

Open the **Devices dialog** to manage saved profiles. There you can **save** the current settings to
a device, **load** a device's profile into the current settings, **rename** a device, or **delete** a
profile. Deleting a profile removes its saved settings, the device gets a fresh profile the next time it connects.

## Root Access

This app may require root access for:

- **Per-App Mode**: Retrieving real audio session IDs via `dumpsys` (not needed when installed as a privileged system app, see Per-App Mode in the Q&A)
- **Debug log viewer**: Reading `logcat` for driver diagnostics

Please make sure the source of any modified APK is trustworthy to avoid any security risks.
